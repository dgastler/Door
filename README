This code reads from the card swipe, searches a mysql database for an entry for the swiped card and opens the door if there is an entry. 
Also, if there is a valid entry, the (id,fist name,last name,swipe id) will be sent to anyone listening to port 1337.

Keyboard setup:
  99-input.rules
Add 99-input.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d/
This will let the group "input" read the raw keyboard events. 
Add the door user to this group.
